RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an
approach to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain
Driven Design, and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD
part of that equation, focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD.

### Documentation

This is the official documentation site for RSpec. Much of the documentation
you see here is written with [Cucumber](http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber),
which, like RSpec, provides _executable documentation_. The Cucumber features
you see here have all been run against RSpec's codebase, serving as
specification, documentation _and_ regression tests of the behavior.

You can also find the RDoc for each sub-project at:

* [rspec-core](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/frames)
* [rspec-expectations](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-expectations/frames)
* [rspec-mocks](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-mocks/frames)
* [rspec-rails](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames)

You can find documentation for rspec-1 at [http://old.rspec.info](http://old.rspec.info)

### Upgrading from RSpec 2.x

We've put a lot of effort into making the upgrade process from RSpec 2.x
to 3.x as smooth as possible, in spite of the fact that it's our first
chance in over 3 years to intentionally make backwards-incompatible
changes. See the [upgrade](./upgrade) documentation for detailed
step-by-step upgrade instructions.
