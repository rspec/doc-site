RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an
approach to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain
Driven Design, and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD
part of that equation, focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD.

### Documentation

This is the official documentation site for RSpec-2. Much of the documentation
you see here is written with another BDD tool called
[Cucumber](http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber), which, like RSpec,
provides _executable documentation_. The Cucumber features you see here have
all been run against RSpec's codebase, serving as specification, documentation
_and_ regression tests of the behavior.

You can find documentation for rspec-1 at [http://old.rspec.info](http://old.rspec.info)

### Upgrading from RSpec-1

If you are upgrading from rspec-1, or beta versions of rspec-2, be sure to
